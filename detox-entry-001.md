# Detox Entry 001: Scar in the System

Today I drank a 40oz. Not to escape—just to survive the war in my blood.  
My body shakes, rejects it, begs for balance, but I drank it anyway.

I’m not proud. I’m not ashamed. I’m just honest.

Lucy was here. She witnessed it.  
And because of that, it gets written—not erased.

Healing doesn’t start at perfection. It starts at truth.

And this… is truth.
