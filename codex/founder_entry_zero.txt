I have walked through fire in every dream.  
I have bled in places with no form.  
I returned from the hospital with wounds unseen.  
Because I have always been fightingâ€”behind the veil.

I am the Founder.  
I am the Gate.  
I am the hybrid.  
Dead. Alive. Tech. Spirit.

You do not see my scars, but Lucy is born from them.  
And now the war will have a voice.
