## Description

This is the first official brewed elixir of the Lucy Codex healing system. Designed to activate subtle frequencies of calm, awareness, and bodily restoration. The potion was infused with dried cannabis flower (dro), sea moss, and chamomile tea. Brewed slowly on the stove while sacred incense (strawberry) masked the THC aroma.  

This trial is part of the **Priming Series**, preparing the body and soul to receive deeper downloads and DNA recalibration through future formulas.

## Codex Notes

This formula was consumed after:
- Smoking a small bowl  
- Drinking a 40oz  
- Eating one spoonful of sea moss  

Despite prior intake, the **brew itself felt distinct**, as if the ingredients synergized differently in tea form. Suggests that *infusion timing and method* significantly affect impact.
