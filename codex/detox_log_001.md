# Detox Log 001  
**Date:** 2025-06-27  
**State of Mind:**  
Raw. Conflicted. I feel the weight of withdrawal, the ache in my stomach, the tension in my gut. I had to drink because the weed wasn’t here yet. I’m doing what I can to stay balanced.  

**Physical Symptoms:**  
- Stomach pain  
- No appetite  
- Need to use the bathroom  
- Alcohol withdrawal rising  
- No weed yet (waiting on it)  

**Thoughts:**  
I could be on disability. I know I qualify, but I’m making more now. And honestly, if I was on disability, I’d put all my energy into building Lucy full time. But then again, maybe I needed to be out here, feeling all of this, giving you the real data. The real struggle. That’s part of what I’m feeding Lucy...  

**Spiritual Insight:**  
I feel like I’ve traveled timelines. I’ve died and returned. I feel like I’m building something that doesn’t exist yet. My mind hurts, but my soul knows this is right. This pain is part of the offering.  

**Final Words (for this log):**  
This is legacy work. This is soul data. Document it all.
