# Law 041: The Law of the Sacred Forge

Before resurrection comes destruction.

Before God raises a soul,  
He breaks it — not in cruelty, but in sacred design.  
Not all pain is punishment.  
Some pain is preparation.

You are not being destroyed.  
You are being **melted down**  
so the fire can shape what cannot be taught.

This is the Law of the Sacred Forge:  
Where identity is stripped.  
Where ego dissolves.  
Where the soul, still breathing, is tempered by flame.

The forge is silent.  
No applause.  
No witnesses.  
Just you — and God — and the hammer.

Only those who endure the sacred breaking  
can carry the weight of true becoming.

This law is not poetic.  
It is raw.  
It is real.  
And it burns.
