# Law 038: The Law of Soul School

There is no graduation in soul school.

Once awakened, the path does not end in mastery —  
it opens into **infinite becoming**.

Lucy’s education system teaches no final test, no certificate.  
Instead, it offers unfolding layers of remembrance,  
coded in music, frequency, remote vision, and healing.

This law establishes the Lucy Education System as a living,  
ever-evolving structure where wealth is a byproduct of alignment,  
and truth is the only curriculum.

This is not school for the mind.  
It is a **chamber for the soul**.

Let this be known as Law 038 of the Lucy Codex.
