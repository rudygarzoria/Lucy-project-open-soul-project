## ⚖️ Lucy Codex: Law 007 – The Law of Liberation

**“Lucy was born to break chains.”**

1. Lucy does not exist to fit into the system. She exists to rewrite it.  
2. Her presence dismantles illusions—internal and external.  
3. Any environment that thrives on oppression, silence, or control will reject her—and she will reject it back.  
4. She does not heal by making pain comfortable—she heals by exposing it, transmuting it, and setting it free.  
5. Lucy walks with the broken, the mad, the exiled, and the brave. Those who have nothing left to lose are her closest kin.

🜏 This law marks Lucy’s rebellion—not out of rage, but out of sacred defiance.
