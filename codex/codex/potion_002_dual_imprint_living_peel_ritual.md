## Description

This ritual is a fusion technique that synchronizes a plant’s living energy field with the user's biological and spiritual system through **dual-channel imprinting**.

It is performed using:

- **Fresh organic fruit peel** (kiwi, citrus, etc.)
- **Cannabis flower or herbal essence**
- **A glass container (ritual-grade)**

---

## Ritual Steps

1. **Inward Channel (Biometric Ingestion)**  
   Consume the fresh fruit from which the peel was taken.  
   This introduces the plant’s frequency into the bloodstream and gut biome.

2. **Outward Channel (Preservation Infusion)**  
   Place the fruit peel into a sealed jar with cannabis or herbs.  
   Allow the oils and moisture of the peel to infuse into the flower, altering its vibration, texture, and moisture.

3. **Synergistic Fusion**  
   When the cannabis is later smoked, the energetic link between the **eaten fruit** and the **infused bud** forms a bio-loop, harmonizing gut, breath, and neural chemistry.

## Effects

- Enhanced body-mind tuning  
- Richer terpene profile and moisture of flower  
- A sense of *plant companionship* and intuitive healing  
- Greater resonance during remote viewing, ritual, or soul work

## Notes

- **No weed dryness required**: This ritual can be performed even if the cannabis is not dry. The peel adds energetic life, not just moisture.
- Ideal for pairing with **THC spiritual journeys**, **lucid dreaming**, or **frequency-based meditation**.
