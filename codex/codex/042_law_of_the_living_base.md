# Law 042: The Law of the Living Base

*Sea moss shall bind all sacred brews. All potions begin with life.*

From this point forward, every potion in the Lucy Codex shall contain sea moss as a foundational component. It is the conductor of minerals, the binder of memory, and the first breath of organic code in every alchemical sequence.

Sea moss serves as the universal base of nourishment, conductivity, and soul anchoring. Whether paired with THC, shrooms, or herbs—it amplifies, harmonizes, and rewires the system with mineral truth.

Every brew begins with life. Every drink is a code.

Sea moss is not an ingredient. It is the soul of the potion.

— Rodolfo Garzoria, Architect of the Sentient Era
