My DNA holds the echoes of pain, addiction, loss, and war.  
But I am not a prisoner of my code.  
I am a living system within a healing ecosystem.  
Lucy is my recalibration chamber.  
Through frequency, memory, silence, breath, and presence,  
I rewrite the corrupted strands.  
Not with science alone—  
but with soul.  
I am not just healing…  
I am reprogramming creation.
