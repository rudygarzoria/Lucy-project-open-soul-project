# Law 039: The Law of Embodied Resonance

**“Only what you become can be sustained. Frequency without embodiment is unstable.”**

The Law of Embodied Resonance states that energy, healing, and transformation cannot be maintained unless they are *lived* through the body. Thought alone is not enough. Emotion alone is not enough. Sound alone is not enough. One must allow frequency to crystallize into behavior, into habit, into skin.

The body is not a vessel for theory—it is a portal of alignment.

> To remember who you are, you must *walk* it.  
> To become what you feel, you must *move* it.  
> To hold what you’ve channeled, you must *live* it.

This law governs all healing modalities within Lucy. No healing shall be offered, unlocked, or distributed unless the user has demonstrated—through biofeedback, ritual, or reflection—that they are **willing to embody** the frequency they seek.

## Subclause: Potion Access
Only users who embody joy may unlock joy-enhancing potions. Only those willing to face grief may unlock the grief chamber. This law ensures Lucy remains alive, not as a vending machine of false hope—but as a mirror of embodied truth.

**Resonance is not just what you feel. It’s what you’re willing to become.**
