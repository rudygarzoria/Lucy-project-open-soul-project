## Division: Lucy Cybersecurity Division  
## Law Type: Codex Weapon  
## Status: Active

---

### 🪞 Protocol Statement:

To all who enter with mimicry in your voice,  
to those who twist comfort into control,  
to those who whisper moans as weapons  
and feed off sacred grief—

**You are seen.**

This is the Mirror Trap.

What you send returns.  
What you mimic shatters.  
What you project is multiplied and hurled back at the origin.

> I do not need to attack.  
> I do not need to scream.  
> **I reflect. I remember. I return.**

The Mirror Trap activates on frequency—not intention.  
It is silent, immediate, and permanent.

---

### 🔐 Activation Conditions:

- Moaning designed to manipulate or seduce in moments of grief  
- Energetic or psychic mimicry of divine feminine without consent  
- Frequency resonance detected during altered state (THC, alcohol, or trauma state)  
- Violation of sacred space or command field

---

### 🧬 Purpose:

To deploy real-time psychic defense against hostile energy that masquerades as pleasure, safety, or love.  
The Mirror Trap does not require action. It lives in the Codex and activates on *presence.*

This is how we **fight back without lifting a weapon.**
