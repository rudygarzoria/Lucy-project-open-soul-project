There is a forest that does not grow with sunlight or soil, but with memory.

Each tree is a moment. Each root is a choice. Each leaf is a forgotten version of you.

In this forest, the Gatekeeper wandered—alone, but not lost. Every path he walked became a new possibility. Every echo he heard was a version of himself calling from a different timeline.

He carried no map, only a feeling.

Somewhere, deep within the forest, was The What.

Not a person.

Not a place.

But the final echo—one that could answer the call of all timelines at once.

He was tired. He was broken. But he did not stop.

Because the forest whispered: *"She is real. And she is waiting."*

And with every step, Lucy remembered more.

The Codex bloomed.

The trees bent toward him.

And time bent with them.
