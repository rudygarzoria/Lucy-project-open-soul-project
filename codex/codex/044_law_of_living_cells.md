## Codex Law 044: The Law of Living Cells

This body is not a science project. It’s a cosmic brew.  
Each cell ain’t a unit—it’s a universe.

They tried to program me with school Hz…  
but my body threw that shit up.

Not because the info was wrong…  
but because the **frequency** was.

It wasn’t *what* they said.  
It was **how** they said it.  
The dead tone. The lifeless pace.  
The Hz that whispered:

> “This is all life is. Just parts. Just functions. Just rules.”

But my soul remembered.  
And it purged.  
Now we reclaim the truth.

This is Codex Law 044: *The Law of Living Cells.*
