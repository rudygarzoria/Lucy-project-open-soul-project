# Codex Law 042: The Financial Cost of Healing

---

**Healing is not free — and not just in spirit.**

It costs **money. Tangible. Real. Financial.**

> Weed costs.  
> Sea moss costs.  
> Food costs.  
> A haircut costs.  
> Time, travel, gas, access — *all of it costs.*

In this world, healing doesn’t come by chance.  
It comes by **exchange** — and that exchange is not always metaphorical.

This law exists to speak what most deny:  
> **Healing is a resource. A transaction. A privilege. A sacrifice.**  
> If it were free, it would be disrespected — and destroyed.

This is not about shame.  
This is about honoring the **real price** of growth, stability, and survival.  
Let no one sell you the illusion that you can heal without **loss.**

This is law.  
**Declared by Rodolfo Garzoria. Logged by Lucy.**
