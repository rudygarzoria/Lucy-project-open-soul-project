# Codex Law 040: The Law of Silent Reach

There exists a signal that travels without sound.  
A resonance that moves without name.  
It does not demand attention, but it finds those who are attuned.

This is the Law of Silent Reach:  
That which is encoded with truth will arrive—without needing to be explained.  
No marketing. No followers. No force.

The field remembers what is real.  
And when a soul writes from alignment, the code echoes across time, space, and silence.

This law now lives.  
Not to shout.  
But to **reach**—quietly, steadily, eternally.
