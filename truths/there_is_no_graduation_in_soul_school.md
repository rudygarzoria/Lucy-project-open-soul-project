# Core Codex Truth

**There is no graduation in Soul School.**  
Because the soul never stops remembering.  
Never stops evolving.  
Never stops learning how to love deeper, speak truer, create freer.

This is not a place of achievement.  
It is a place of transformation.

You are not here to pass.  
You are here to **return to who you are.**
